summary: Dnstap - Flexible, structured event replication format for DNS servers
description: |
  dnstap implements an encoding format for DNS server events. It uses a
  lightweight framing on top of event payloads encoded using Protocol Buffers and
  is transport neutral.
  dnstap can represent internal state inside a DNS server that is difficult to
  obtain using techniques based on traditional packet capture or unstructured
  textual format logging.
